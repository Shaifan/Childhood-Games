{"diseases":[{"id_disease":"1","name":"Fever ","details":"Fever, also known as pyrexia and febrile response","symptoms":"A fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior, which consists of lethargy, depression, anorexia, sleepiness, hyperalgesia, and the inability to concentrate.","medications":"Medications that lower fevers are called antipyretics. The antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fevers in children. It is more effective than acetaminophen (paracetamol) in children. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers. The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned. Ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with fevers. Additionally, aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.\r\n\r\nUsing both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen. It is not clear if it increases child comfort. Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.","create_on":"2017-02-08 00:00:00","updated_on":"2017-02-08 16:39:04"},{"id_disease":"2","name":"Cough","details":"Cough","symptoms":"Cough","medications":"Cough","create_on":null,"updated_on":"2017-02-08 17:22:59"},{"id_disease":"3","name":"Cold","details":"Cold","symptoms":"Cold","medications":"Cold","create_on":null,"updated_on":"2017-02-08 17:23:20"}]}
